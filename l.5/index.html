	<p>I'm learning Spanish with Rosettastone and I'm really enjoying the experience. I've always liked the idea of being able to speak another language and, since I regularly holiday in Spain, felt that Spanish would be ideal for me. Having had a pretty poor experience of being taught French when at school I had some initial reservations but am pleased to say that </p>
